Movie_recommendation
This repository contains a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system built using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Surprise. The project demonstrates how to preprocess datasets, clean data, and implement a recommendation model.

Project Overview
Project Overview The goal of this project is to build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and past interactions. It involves two main stages:

Data Acquisition and Cleaning: Cleaning and preprocessing the provided movie and rating datasets. Recommendation System: Implementing collaborative filtering to generate movie recommendations.

Dataset Description
movies.csv Contains details about movies. Columns include movieId, title, genres, and (optional) poster_path.
ratings_cleaned.csv Contains user ratings for movies. Columns include userId, movieId, rating, and timestamp.
Results
The recommendation system predicts top-rated movies for users using collaborative filtering. Provides accurate suggestions based on user behavior and preferences.
